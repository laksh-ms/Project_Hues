        <em>Meditative Hues</em> is a creative meditation technique by painting, which is
        a great example of meditation art—the main goal is to clear your mind of
        everything except the paints, brushes, and paper in an effort to enter
        into a meditative flow.<br /><br />

        When you paint from this place, it is less about techniques and more
        about letting go and just entering into the experience. This is a very
        therapeutic way of painting. As someone who has struggled with anxiety,
        it has quickly become my place of serenity. <br /><br />

        So, to recap, <em>Meditative Hues</em> is being mindful and present while putting
        paint on paper with or without a final vision in mind.
